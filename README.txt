A simple NAK-based reliable multicast service. The code is very incomplete, as 
it was salvaged from an intermediate backup after my (very) old laptop died. At 
the moment, it won't even compile, let alone run. I just thought I'd get 
whatever's left there before I lose it again :-P

It's from way back in 2004 in grad school, and was started to support multicast-
based file replication and synchronization for a multi-server distributed file 
system for the final project of an Operating Systems course.
